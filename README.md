# Meal-Recommender
A machine-learning approach for personalized nutrition guidance

## Project Overview
This project builds a personalized meal recommendation system using Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT).
The goal is to analyze an individual’s gut health profile, dietary habits, and nutritional indicators to recommend meals that support a healthier microbiome.
Previously, a Decision Tree classifier was developed and evaluated. However, due to the complexity and noisiness of the dataset, we transitioned to Gradient Boosted Trees, which offer improved predictive performance through boosting and ensemble learning.
This repository contains:
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Feature engineering + preprocessing steps
✔ Gradient Boosted Trees model development
✔ Model evaluation metrics
✔ Interpretation of key predictive features
✔ Code notebook for reproducibility

## Motivation
Healthy gut function plays a major role in digestion, immunity, inflammation, and even mood. Personalized nutrition powered by machine learning can help individuals make data-driven meal choices that better support their microbiome.
Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs) are especially effective here because they:


Handle non-linear relationships among diet + health indicators


Perform well with mixed data types


Are resilient to moderate noise


Provide feature importance insights, improving interpretability


## Tech Stack


Python


Pandas, NumPy


Scikit-learn (GradientBoostingClassifier, preprocessing, metrics)


Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA + visualization)


Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes:


Distribution of key gut-health attributes


Macro/micronutrient correlations


Outlier detection


Feature relationships and patterns


Data cleaning + imbalance handling


## Model Development
### 1. Preprocessing


Handling missing values


One-hot encoding for categorical features


Normalization/standardization


Balancing class distribution


Feature selection based on correlation analysis


### 2. Model
We train a Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) model to classify each input into meal categories most suitable for the individual’s health profile.
### 3. Evaluation
Metrics include:


Accuracy


Precision / Recall / F1-score


Confusion matrix


Feature importance ranking


GBT provided a significant improvement in performance compared to the standalone Decision Tree model.

## Results Summary


Improved model robustness and generalization


Reduced overfitting compared to Decision Trees


High impact features include:


Nutrient ratios


Age & BMI


Microbiome indicators


Dietary patterns


## Future Improvements


Add deep learning models for more nuanced predictions


Build a frontend UI for interactive meal recommendations


Integrate real microbiome sequencing data


Deploy the model via API or web app
