# Meal Recommender – AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition


## 📌 Problem Statement

In recent years, the connection between **gut microbiome composition**, **dietary habits**, and **overall health** has gained significant attention. Personalized nutrition—especially meal planning based on gut health indicators and lifestyle factors—offers a promising path toward improving **metabolic**, **digestive**, and **inflammatory conditions**.

The goal of this project is to develop a **scalable machine learning model** that can predict **personalized meal plans** based on:
- Gut microbiome profile (e.g., Bacteroides, Firmicutes)
- Dietary intake (protein, fiber, carbohydrate, fat)
- Demographic features (age, gender, BMI)
- Food allergy data

The system is built using **PySpark and Spark MLlib**, optimized for **big data environments**, with interpretable visualizations and clinically relevant outcomes.


## 📂 Data Selection

**Source**: American Gut Project and lifestyle survey data

**Data Features**:
- **Microbiome Indicators**: Bacteroides, Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, etc.
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, BMI
- **Nutrient Intake**: Protein, Fiber, Carbohydrates, Fat
- **Allergies**: Dairy, Gluten, Nuts

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Most users consume **moderate levels** of protein and fiber.
- **Meal plan labels are imbalanced**, heavily skewed toward a few diets.
- Age and BMI trends vary across plans, suggesting feature relevance.

**Challenges Identified**:
- Significant **class imbalance** in target labels.

## 🧠 Model Selection

### 1. Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Interpretable and fast
- Limited in handling non-linear relationships

### 2. Decision Tree
- Easy to interpret
- Prone to overfitting with class imbalance

### 3. Random Forest ✅ *(Chosen Model)*
- Handles non-linearity and mixed feature types
- Reduced overfitting; better overall performance

### 4. Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) + One-vs-Rest
- High potential for accuracy
- More resource intensive and complex to tune


## 🛠️ Data Preparation

- **Categorical Encoding**: Converted text labels like “High Protein” into numeric indices
- **Allergy Normalization**: Cleaned inconsistent allergy formats
- **Class Balancing**:
  - Method 1: Upsample minority classes
  - Method 2: Merge similar rare classes and resample


## 📌 Feature Selection

### Method 1: Correlation Matrix
- Assessed relationships between numeric variables

### Method 2
- Chi Square test to select the categorical features
- Correlation matrix to assess the independence of each numerical variable
